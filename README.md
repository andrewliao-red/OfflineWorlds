OFFLINE WORLDS

PRESS ‘Start’ to remember…

Offline Worlds is an online archive that documents 
video games + franchises whose servers have shut down with no proceeding plans by their creators & developers.

CONCEPT

Offline Worlds is an online archive where people who also share the sense of nostalgia for particular video games that are no longer playable can share info about their video games that they can only ever wish to be able to play again.

If people wish for their ‘dead game’ to be displayed in the archive, they can fill out an online form and provide any important information they wish to include for the archive. 

The style will be in pixel art, as it is a quick and simple way to showcase particular images, and pays homage to the early history of the first-ever video games to be made, as they, too, were done in pixels.

It starts with an opening interface showing the title for Offline Worlds along with a ‘Play’ button.

The player controls a character who ventures into the Offline Worlds museum using WASD keys/arrow keys to move their character around the museum.

If a player stops near a character from a recognizable video game and clicks on them, a sidebar will appear, displaying the name of the popular game the character is from.

Information will include:
Year of Publication — Year of Shutdown / Death
Sequels of a game, if the game has more than one in the franchise.
Publishers and Game Developers
Themes, Styles, and brief summary of the video game
Elements that made this game popular
Cause of shutdown

MEDIUM

The Offline Worlds project will be a digital website in the format of a video game.

CALL TO ACTION:

While the general cause is to encourage people to support this archive by posting their favorite video games that have died out and perhaps build something of a community, there is actually a deeper meaning for this website…

It is to teach people that 
every game holds a piece of our collective culture 
that is worth  remembering and protecting.

To preserve games is to preserve the culture that 
created them

Many people grew up enjoying video games, encircling their culture around it or associated with it. But when these games shut down, a good chunk of this culture is stripped away.

What disappears isn’t just code or servers. It’s the worlds we explored. The friendships we formed. The creativity we expressed, and the memories that defined an era of our lives. 

Preserving these games means preserving who we were and how we connected. Every game, regardless of popularity or recognition, holds a piece of our life story. And that story deserves to be remembered and protected.
